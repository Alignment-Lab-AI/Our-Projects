# Welcome to Our Projects

Welcome to an extensive collection of projects being developed or supported by Alignment Lab AI. Our mission is to shape the future of AI with groundbreaking work, and we invite you to join us in this venture. If you are interested in our projects and want to be part of this exciting journey, [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/n9hXaBPWxx) and visit our [website](alignmentlab.ai). We fund H100s on an as-needed basis for our projects and other interesting initiatives we come across, so if youve got something cool you want to work on, or youve got something cool in the works let us know!

Dive into these initiatives and engage with the authors and repository owners. Their work is inspiring and together, we can reach new heights.

## Direct Projects by Alignment Lab AI

1. **[Landmark Attention Qlora](https://github.com/eugenepentland/landmark-attention-qlora)**: An integral part of the "Infinite Extension" project. We're using Landmark Attention and Qlora to address the issue of context length. Currently, we have a 13B model and are in the process of integrating SPOS, custom architecture, and optimizing for consumer hardware resource usage. We are actively integrating the features ot he featured collaborations and expect to continue to make great progress. (70k on open llama and 5k on minotaur so far!)

## Featured Collaborations

### [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)
A product of the Open Access AI Collective. This training wrapper aims to democratize AI by creating accessible tools, high-quality models, and educational materials. Our team is actively contributing to this project.

### [OpenLlama-7b-4k](https://huggingface.co/openaccess-ai-collective/openllama-7b-4k) & [Falcon-7b-4k-alibi](https://huggingface.co/openaccess-ai-collective/falcon-7b-4k-alibi)
Initiatives of the Open Access AI Collective. We are closely involved in the development of these projects, which represent the next mechanisms we plan to incorporate into our work.
